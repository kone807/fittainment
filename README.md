# fittainment
Repository for PIS major project at IIITD for monsoon 2019 

Fittainment addresses the growing issue of ill health in people of all age groups and occupations, be it students, the working class, home-makers, etc. All of us neglect our health, always stating that - we want to but don't have the time or find it boring.

If that is your reason as well, FITTAINMENT is your solution! Now, exercise while you play! Fittainment is a user-friendly gaming interface designed using Arduino and processing. It involves three kinds of exercises - hand gripper, jumping, and climbing stairs, and there are three apt games associated with each of them, providing mental relaxation along with physical workout, thus providing a wholesome package to the user.

We decided to add in the theme of NARUTO to our project! All of us love the orange jump-suit wearing ninja and Sasuke Uchiha, the wielder of Sharingan and Rinnegan. Their story motivates us to work hard and never give up, which is one of the underlying purposes of this project and the motivation which made us complete this project and learn!
